{"name":"Connections","body":"# Connections\r\n\r\nMost social apps need some kind of follow/like/watch/stalk/etc\r\nfeatures that connects one model to another.\r\n\r\nInstead of having to recreate this functionality for every project I\r\ndecided to create a gem that easily allows you to add these features\r\nusing any naming you prefer.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd the gem to the gemfile:\r\n`gem \"connections\"`\r\n\r\nInstall migration:\r\n`rake connections:install:migrations`\r\n\r\nThis generates a migration that creates a single join table for\r\nkeeping track of what is connected to what.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nUse `connects_with` to enable a model to connect to other models and\r\n`connectable_with ` to allow a model to be connected to using\r\nwhatever naming scheme you prefer (follow, like, watch, etc)\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  connects_with :follow, :like\r\n  connectable_with :follow\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  connectable_with :like\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nDepending on the naming scheme you choose Connections will try to figure out the\r\ngrammar and add appropriately named methods. For example in the case of\r\n\"Follow\" and \"Like\" the following methods will be added:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Follow\r\nuser.follow(other_user) # Creates a 'Follow' connection user -> other_user\r\nuser.unfollow(other_user) # Removes 'Follow' connection user -> other_user\r\nuser.toggle_follow(other_user) # Toggles the connection on/off\r\nuser.follows?(other_user) # Returns true if the user if following other_user\r\nuser.following(:user) # Returns a list of all the users the user is following\r\nother_user.followers(:user) #Returns a list of all the user's followers\r\n\r\n# Like\r\nuser.like(post)\r\nuser.unlike(post)\r\nuser.toggle_like(post)\r\nuser.likes?(post)\r\nuser.liking(:post)\r\npost.likers(:user)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it! If you want to add extra functionality to the join model (such\r\nas using callbacks etc) you can explicitly define the model in your\r\nproject like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Follow < Connections::Connection\r\n  ...\r\nend\r\n```","tagline":"Easily add follow/like/watch/stalk capabilities to any ActiveRecord model","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
